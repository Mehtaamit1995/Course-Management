Design Decisions:

Node.js and MongoDB: Node.js is a popular choice for building server-side applications due to its non-blocking I/O model, 
which makes it well-suited for handling concurrent requests. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was chosen for its flexibility and 
scalability, making it suitable for storing course and user data.

RESTful API: The system follows the principles of a RESTful API to provide a consistent and standardized way of accessing 
resources. API endpoints are designed to follow RESTful conventions for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting data.

Token-based Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for user authentication. This approach eliminates the need for 
session management on the server, making the application stateless and scalable.

Data Validation and Error Handling: Data validation and error handling are implemented to ensure that incoming requests are 
properly validated and appropriate error responses are provided to clients.

Modular Code Structure: The codebase is organized into modules, each responsible for specific features. This promotes code 
reusability, maintainability, and easier collaboration among developers.


Challenges Faced:

Authentication and Security: Implementing secure authentication and ensuring the security of user data were essential challenges. 
Careful consideration was given to password hashing and JWT token management to prevent unauthorized access.

Concurrency and Scalability: Ensuring that the application could handle concurrent requests and scale appropriately to handle 
increasing user traffic was a challenge. Proper asynchronous programming and using MongoDB's features for scalability were employed.

Data Modeling and Relationships: Designing the data models and defining relationships between different entities, such as courses, 
users, and enrollments, required thoughtful consideration to create an efficient database schema.

Notifications Feature: Implementing the notifications feature involved creating a system for storing, sending, and tracking 
notifications for each user. Proper database schema design and managing read/unread status were essential aspects of this feature.


Additional Comments:

The Course Management System provides a robust foundation for managing courses, enrollment, and student progress. It can be 
extended to include more advanced features like analytics, reporting, and automated notifications.

For a production deployment, it is recommended to set up secure access controls, rate limiting, and monitor application performance 
to ensure reliability and security.

As with any real-world application, continuous testing, security audits, and regular updates are necessary to maintain the integrity 
and security of the system. Regularly reviewing and updating dependencies is crucial to mitigate vulnerabilities.
